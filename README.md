# Minimax Tic-Tac-Toe Demo

Simply run: $ python minimax.py

The opponent maximizes their turn by doing a minimax search of the successor states possible. The turn that leads to the most possible wins is chosen as the successor. The human player must then input a coordinate as a row,col (e.g. 0,0 for the top left corner) to specify where their tile should be placed.


The AI is always the 'X' player, as the 'X' player can always win by going first and playing optimally.


Good luck :)
